# verify_elements Function in WASM

## Summary

The `verify_elements` function from Drive cannot be fully implemented in the WASM environment due to fundamental architectural limitations.

## The Issue

1. **Element Type Not Exposed**: The `grovedb::Element` enum is only available when the "server" feature is enabled, not with the "verify" feature that wasm-drive-verify uses.

2. **Security by Design**: This limitation appears intentional - the verify feature is designed to work with serialized data only, preventing exposure of internal tree structures across the WASM boundary.

3. **Type Dependencies**: The Element enum contains variants like:
   - `Item(Vec<u8>)` - raw data
   - `Tree(Option<Vec<u8>>)` - tree reference  
   - `SumTree(Option<Vec<u8>>, i64)` - sum tree with value
   - `SumItem(Vec<u8>, i64)` - item with sum

These types reference internal GroveDB structures that cannot be safely exposed in WASM.

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of `verify_elements`, use the specialized verification functions:

### 1. For Documents
```rust
// Use DriveDocumentQuery
let query = DriveDocumentQuery::new(...);
let (root_hash, documents) = query.verify_proof_keep_serialized(proof, platform_version)?;
```

### 2. For Identities
```rust
// Use identity-specific functions
let (root_hash, identity) = verify_full_identity_by_identity_id(proof, identity_id, platform_version)?;
```

### 3. For Contracts
```rust
// Use contract verification
let (root_hash, contract) = verify_contract(proof, contract_id, platform_version)?;
```

## Current Implementation

The `verify_elements` function in wasm-drive-verify returns an error explaining this limitation and directing users to the appropriate alternative functions.

## Future Considerations

If raw element access is absolutely needed in WASM:

1. **Custom Serialization**: Implement a custom serialization format for Elements on the server side that can be deserialized in WASM
2. **Proof Format Changes**: Modify the proof format to include pre-serialized elements
3. **Feature Flag**: Add a new feature flag that exposes a limited, WASM-safe version of Element

However, these approaches would require significant changes to the core Drive/GroveDB architecture and may compromise the security model.
