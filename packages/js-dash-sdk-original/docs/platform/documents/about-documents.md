## What is a document 

Documents in Dash Platform are similar to those in standard document-oriented databases (MongoDB,...).
They represent a record consisting of one, or multiples field-value pairs and should respect the structure of the dataContract on which they are submitted in.

See more on the Dash Platform documentation about [Data Contract](https://dashplatform.readme.io/docs/explanation-platform-protocol-data-contract).
