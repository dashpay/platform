## Install

### ES5/ES6 via NPM

In order to use this library, you will need to add it to your project as a dependency.

Having [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed, just type : `npm install dash` in your terminal.

```sh
npm install dash
```


### CDN Standalone

For browser usage, you can also directly rely on unpkg : 

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/dash"></script>
```

## Usage

```js
const Dash = require("dash"); // or import Dash from "dash"

const client = new Dash.Client({
  network: "testnet",
  wallet: {
    mnemonic: "arena light cheap control apple buffalo indicate rare motor valid accident isolate",
  },
});

// Accessing an account allow you to transact with the Dash Network
client.getWalletAccount().then(async (account) => {
  console.log("Funding address", account.getUnusedAddress().address);

  const balance = account.getConfirmedBalance();
  console.log("Confirmed Balance", balance);

  if(balance > 0){
    // Creating an identity is the basis of all interactions with the Dash Platform
    const identity = await client.platform.identities.register()
    
    // Prepare a new document containing a simple hello world sent to a hypothetical tutorial contract
    const document = await platform.documents.create(
      'tutorialContract.note',
      identity,
      { message: 'Hello World' },
    );

    // Broadcast the document into a new state transition
    await platform.documents.broadcast({create:[document]}, identity);
  }
});
```

### Primitives and essentials
Dash SDK bundled into a standalone package, 
so that the end user never have to worry about mananaging polyfills or related dependencies 

```javascript
const Dash = require('dash')

const {
  Essentials: {
    Buffer  // Node.JS Buffer polyfill.
  },
  Core: { // @dashevo/dashcore-lib essentials
    Transaction, 
    PrivateKey,
    BlockHeader,
  },
  PlatformProtocol: { // @dashevo/dpp essentials
    Identity,
    Identifier,
  },
  WalletLib: { // @dashevo/wallet-lib essentials
    EVENTS
  },
  DAPIClient, // @dashevo/dapi-client
} = Dash;
``` 

## Dependencies 

The Dash SDK works using multiple dependencies that might interest you:
- [Wallet-Lib](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/wallet-lib) - Wallet management for handling, signing and broadcasting transactions (BIP-44 HD).
- [Dashcore-Lib](https://github.com/dashevo/dashcore-lib) - Provides the main L1 blockchain primitives (Block, Transaction,...).
- [DAPI-Client](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/js-dapi-client) - Client library for accessing DAPI endpoints.
- [DPP](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/js-dpp) - Implementation (JS) of Dash Platform Protocol.

Some features might be more extensive in those libs, as Dash SDK only wraps around them to provide a single interface that is easy to use (and thus has less features).
