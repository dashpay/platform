Client library used to access Dash DAPI endpoints

This library enables HTTP-based interaction with the Dash blockchain and Dash
Platform via the decentralized API ([DAPI](https://github.com/dashevo/dapi))
hosted on Dash masternodes.

 - `DAPI-Client` provides automatic server (masternode) discovery using either a default seed node or a user-supplied one
 - `DAPI-Client` maps to DAPI's [RPC](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/dapi/lib/rpcServer/commands) and [gRPC](https://github.com/dashevo/platform/tree/master/packages/dapi/lib/grpcServer/handlers) endpoints

## Install

```sh
npm install @dashevo/dapi-client
```

## Usage

### Basic

```javascript
const DAPIClient = require('@dashevo/dapi-client');
const client = new DAPIClient();

client.core.getStatus().then((coreStatus) => {
  console.dir(coreStatus);
});
```

### Custom seed node

Custom seed nodes are necessary for connecting the client to devnets since the client library is unaware of them otherwise.

```javascript
const DAPIClient = require('@dashevo/dapi-client');

var client = new DAPIClient({
  seeds: [{
     host: 'seed-1.evonet.networks.dash.org',
     httpPort: 3000,
     grpcPort: 3010,
  }],
});

client.core.getBestBlockHash().then((r) => {
  console.log(r);
});
```

**Note**: The seed node shown above (`seed-1.evonet.networks.dash.org`) is for the Dash Evonet testing network.

### Custom addresses

Custom addresses may be directly specified in cases where it is beneficial to know exactly what node(s) are being accessed (e.g. debugging, local development, etc.).

```javascript
const DAPIClient = require('@dashevo/dapi-client');

var client = new DAPIClient({
  dapiAddresses: [
    '127.0.0.1:3000:3010',
    '127.0.0.2:3000:3010',
  ],
});

client.core.getBestBlockHash().then((r) => {
  console.log(r);
});
```

### Command specific options

DAPI Client options can be passed directly to any command to override any predefined client options and modify the client's behavior for that specific call.

```javascript
const DAPIClient = require('@dashevo/dapi-client');

// Set options to direct the request to a specific address and disable retries
const options = {
  dapiAddresses: ['127.0.0.1'],
  retries: 0,
};

client.core.getBestBlockHash(options).then((r) => {
  console.log(r);
});
```
