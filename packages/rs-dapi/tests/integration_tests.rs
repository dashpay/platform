 * Integration tests for rs-dapi server
 *
 * These tests demonstrate best practices for integration testing:
 * 1. Modular test organization with shared setup utilities
 * 2. Single setup() function that handles all initialization
 * 3. Automatic port management to avoid conflicts
 * 4. Clean server lifecycle management
 * 5. Mock clients for predictable and fast test execution
