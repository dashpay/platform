//! Shared tokio runtime for blocking on async wallet operations.
//!
//! ## Stack size
//!
//! iOS dispatch/concurrency worker threads default to ~512 KB of stack.
//! Proof verification in `rs-drive` recurses through GroveDB deeply
//! enough to blow past that — we've seen `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` at
//! `verify_state_transition_was_executed_with_proof`'s function
//! prologue, which is the classic fingerprint of a stack-guard hit.
//!
//! Two mitigations together:
//!
//! 1. Configure the worker-thread stack to 8 MB (matches what rs-sdk
//!    uses internally for similar reasons).
//! 2. Dispatch the heavy async work onto a worker via
//!    [`block_on_worker`] instead of polling directly on the
//!    (small-stacked) calling thread. `block_on` itself still runs
//!    on the caller, but it parks almost immediately — all the
//!    compute happens on the tokio worker.

/// Worker thread stack size for the shared runtime. 8 MB gives proof
/// verification + GroveDB comfortable headroom without meaningfully
/// affecting memory footprint (we spin up a small number of workers).

///
/// All async FFI functions use this runtime. Prefer
/// [`block_on_worker`] over `runtime().block_on(...)` so the heavy
/// work runs on a worker thread with the larger stack configured
/// here, rather than the (small) calling thread.
