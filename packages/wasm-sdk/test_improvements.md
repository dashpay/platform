# Testing the Improved Where Clause Dropdowns

## Summary of Improvements

### 1. **Fixed Operator Dropdown Options**
- Removed invalid operators: `!=`, `contains`, `endsWith`, `elementMatch`
- Only shows valid Dash Platform operators:
  - `==` (Equal) - for all types
  - `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=` - for numeric types only
  - `startsWith` - for strings only
  - `in` - for all types

### 2. **Compound Index Validation**
- Visual indicators showing property positions in the index (green, blue, orange badges)
- Real-time validation that enforces compound index rules
- Clear error messages when trying to use range queries on non-first properties without equality on preceding properties

### 3. **Support for Multiple Range Clauses**
- "Add Range" button appears when selecting a range operator
- Can add a second range condition on the same field
- Automatically combines into appropriate Between operator:
  - `>` + `<` → `BetweenExcludeBounds`
  - `>=` + `<=` → `Between`
  - `>` + `<=` → `BetweenExcludeLeft`
  - `>=` + `<` → `BetweenExcludeRight`

### 4. **Query Preview**
- Live preview showing the exact query structure
- Shows how range clauses will be combined
- Updates in real-time as you modify inputs

### 5. **Enhanced UI/UX**
- Field type indicators (string, integer, date, identifier)
- Compound index rules displayed prominently
- Validation errors prevent invalid queries from being executed
- Better visual hierarchy with grouped range clauses

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the web server**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/quantum/src/platform/packages/wasm-sdk
   python3 -m http.server 8888
   ```

2. **Open browser**:
   Navigate to http://localhost:8888

3. **Test scenarios**:

   ### A. Test Valid Operators
   - Select Document Queries → Get Documents
   - Enter a contract ID and document type
   - Click "Load Contract"
   - Select an index
   - Verify only valid operators appear for each field type

   ### B. Test Compound Index Validation
   - Select an index with multiple properties
   - Try to add a range query on the second property without equality on the first
   - Verify error message appears
   - Add equality on first property, then range on second
   - Verify error disappears

   ### C. Test Multiple Range Clauses
   - Select a numeric field
   - Choose `>` operator and enter a value
   - Click "+ Add Range" button
   - Add `<` operator with a higher value
   - Verify the preview shows it will become a Between operator

   ### D. Test Query Preview
   - Build various queries
   - Verify the preview updates correctly
   - Check that IN clauses show arrays properly
   - Verify Between operators show correct bounds

## Known Limitations

1. Only one IN clause allowed per query (platform limitation)
2. Range queries must be on indexed fields
3. All properties before a range property must have equality constraints
4. Maximum of 2 range clauses per field (will be combined)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add autocomplete for field values based on data type
2. Add query history/favorites
3. Add query templates for common patterns
4. Add export/import of queries
5. Add query performance hints based on index usage
