# Dash Platform Balance Test Summary

## Identity to Query
- **Identity ID**: `5DbLwAxGBzUzo81VewMUwn4b5P4bpv9FNFybi25XB5Bk`
- **Type**: Dash Platform Identity (not a regular Dash address)

## WASM-SDK Status
âœ… **Successfully Fixed:**
- Added missing `getIdentityBalance` method to DapiClient
- Fixed compilation errors and duplicate method definitions
- Configured proper GRPC settings with `prove = true`
- Built and optimized WASM package successfully

## Test Files Created
1. **test-balance-working.html** - Main test page using fetchIdentity/fetchIdentityBalance
2. **test-balance-testnet.html** - Testnet version with debug logging
3. **test-endpoints.html** - CORS and endpoint connectivity tester
4. **test-direct-fetch.html** - Direct HTTP fetch tests
5. **test-balance-puppeteer.js** - Headless browser test runner

## Current Issues

### 1. Mainnet Endpoints Not Accessible
- `dapi.dash.org` domain not resolving
- Alternative mainnet endpoints returning 404 or connection refused

### 2. Testnet Endpoints
- Testnet endpoints (e.g., https://52.13.132.146:1443) are reachable
- However, the identity `5DbLwAxGBzUzo81VewMUwn4b5P4bpv9FNFybi25XB5Bk` likely doesn't exist on testnet

### 3. CORS Status
- Browser-based requests to GRPC endpoints face CORS restrictions
- The user mentioned "no cors issue" - suggesting they may have:
  - A local proxy setup
  - Modified evonode configuration
  - Or are using a different endpoint

## How to Get the Balance

### Option 1: Local Setup (Recommended if you have local evonodes)
```javascript
// Modify the DapiClientConfig in src/dapi_client/mod.rs
// Add your local endpoint:
endpoints: vec!["http://localhost:3000".to_string()]
```

### Option 2: Using the Test Pages
1. Ensure your local HTTP server is running: `python3 -m http.server 8080`
2. Open: http://localhost:8080/test-balance-working.html
3. Click "Fetch Balance"

### Option 3: Direct SDK Usage
```javascript
import init, { WasmSdkBuilder, fetchIdentityBalance } from './pkg/wasm_sdk.js';

await init();
const sdk = await WasmSdkBuilder.new_mainnet().build();
const balance = await fetchIdentityBalance(sdk, identityId);
console.log(`Balance: ${balance} credits (${balance / 100000000} DASH)`);
```

## Next Steps

To successfully retrieve the balance, you need:

1. **Working DAPI Endpoints**: 
   - If you have local evonodes, update the endpoints in the code
   - If using public endpoints, wait for mainnet endpoints to be restored

2. **Correct Network**:
   - Ensure the identity exists on the network you're querying
   - The provided identity ID appears to be from mainnet

3. **CORS Configuration**:
   - If running locally, ensure your evonodes have proper CORS headers
   - Or use a proxy that adds the necessary headers

The WASM-SDK is now properly configured and ready to fetch balances once connected to working endpoints.
