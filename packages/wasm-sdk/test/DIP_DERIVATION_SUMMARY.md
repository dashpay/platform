# DIP Derivation Tests - Summary

## Overview

Comprehensive test coverage has been added for all Dash Improvement Proposals (DIPs) related to key derivation:

- **DIP9**: Feature-based derivation paths
- **DIP13**: HD derivation for Dash Identities  
- **DIP14**: Extended key derivation (256-bit paths)
- **DIP15**: DashPay HD derivation paths

## Test Results

**19 tests created, 19 passing (100% pass rate)**

## Test Categories

### DIP9 - Feature Derivation Paths (4 tests)
- ✅ Basic structure validation for mainnet/testnet
- ✅ Different feature values (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15)
- ✅ Actual key derivation with DIP9 paths

### DIP13 - HD Derivation for Dash Identities (7 tests)
- ✅ Identity root paths (mainnet/testnet)
- ✅ Multiple identity indices
- ✅ Authentication key paths: `m/9'/5'/5'/0'/0'/identity_index'/key_index'`
- ✅ Registration funding paths: `m/9'/5'/5'/1'/identity_index`
- ✅ Top-up funding paths: `m/9'/5'/5'/2'/funding_index`
- ✅ Invitation funding paths: `m/9'/5'/5'/3'/funding_index'`

### DIP14 - Extended Key Derivation (2 tests)
- ✅ Backwards compatibility with BIP32
- ✅ Large index support (up to 2^31-1)

### DIP15 - DashPay HD Derivation (2 tests)
- ✅ Feature 15 path structure
- ✅ Incoming funds base path

### Cross-DIP Integration (2 tests)
- ✅ DIP9 + DIP13 integration
- ✅ Multiple identity key derivation

### Edge Cases (2 tests)
- ✅ Hardened vs non-hardened paths
- ✅ Identity recovery determinism

## Key Findings

1. **DIP9 Implementation**: Correctly implements feature-based paths with purpose 9'
2. **DIP13 Support**: Full support for all identity key types (auth, funding, top-up, invitation)
3. **Path Components**: BIP44/DIP9 helper functions return components, DIP13 functions return full paths
4. **Hardening**: SDK accepts both hardened and non-hardened paths (produces different keys)
5. **Deterministic**: Same mnemonic + path always produces same keys

## Path Examples

```javascript
// DIP9 Feature Path
"m/9'/5'/5'/0/0"  // purpose=9', coin=5' (Dash), feature=5'

// DIP13 Identity Authentication Key
"m/9'/5'/5'/0'/0'/0'/0'"  // First auth key of first identity

// DIP13 Registration Funding
"m/9'/5'/5'/1'/0"  // Funding address for first identity

// DIP15 DashPay Base Path
"m/9'/5'/15'/0'"  // Feature 15 for DashPay
```

## Integration with Test Suite

The DIP derivation tests have been integrated into the main test runner and will be executed as part of the comprehensive test suite. This ensures that all DIP standards are properly tested alongside other SDK functionality.
