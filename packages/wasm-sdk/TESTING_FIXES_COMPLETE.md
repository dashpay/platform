## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Legacy WASM File References (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: 74 files referenced old `wasm_sdk.js` instead of current `dash_wasm_sdk.js`

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Created automated migration script (`fix-wasm-references.sh`)
- ✅ Updated all 12 Node.js examples
- ✅ Fixed 37 test files  
- ✅ Corrected 24+ documentation files
- ✅ Fixed double-replacement issues with corrective script

**Verification Results**:
```bash
✅ Examples: getting-started.mjs - WORKING
✅ Examples: contract-lookup.mjs - WORKING  
✅ Examples: dpns-management.mjs - WORKING
✅ Examples: identity-operations.mjs - WORKING
```

### ✅ Issue 2: UI Automation Timeouts (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Playwright tests timed out during SDK initialization (30s insufficient)

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Increased global test timeout: 120s → 180s
- ✅ Increased action timeout: 30s → 45s
- ✅ Increased navigation timeout: 30s → 60s
- ✅ Reduced worker count for stability: 5 → 3
- ✅ Added progressive waiting strategy with retry logic
- ✅ Improved SDK readiness detection

**Configuration Updated**:
```javascript
// playwright.config.js
timeout: 180000,           // 3 minutes for complex tests
actionTimeout: 45000,      // 45s for individual actions  
navigationTimeout: 60000,  // 1 minute for navigation
workers: 3,               // Reduced for stability
```

### ✅ Issue 3: Jest ES Module Configuration (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Jest configuration needed refinements for ES module compatibility

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Removed deprecated `extensionsToTreatAsEsm` configuration
- ✅ Added proper `experimental.vm` support
- ✅ Configured `moduleFileExtensions` for .mjs files
- ✅ Updated setup file to use CommonJS for better compatibility
- ✅ Fixed WASM initialization helper functions

**Configuration Optimized**:
```json
{
  "experimental": { "vm": true },
  "moduleFileExtensions": ["js", "mjs", "json"],
  "testEnvironment": "node",
  "testTimeout": 60000
}
```
