# Proof Verification Implementation Status

## Overview

This document describes the current state of proof verification in the wasm-sdk after successfully integrating the `drive` crate with the `verify` feature.

## Current Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented

1. **Identity Proof Verification** (`verify.rs`)
   - `verify_identity_by_id()` - Fully functional
   - Uses `wasm-drive-verify` successfully

2. **Data Contract Proof Verification** (`verify.rs`)
   - `verify_data_contract_by_id()` - Fully functional
   - Uses `wasm-drive-verify` successfully

3. **Single Document Verification** (`verify_bridge.rs`)
   - `verifySingleDocument()` - Fully implemented
   - Can verify a single document by ID with proof

4. **Document Query Proof Verification** (`verify.rs`)
   - `verifyDocumentsWithContract()` - Fully implemented
   - Supports complex queries with where clauses and ordering
   - Requires the DataContract to be provided (as CBOR bytes)

### ⚠️ Limitations

1. **Automatic Proof Verification in Fetch**
   - Not implemented to avoid circular dependencies
   - Users can manually verify after fetching
   - DAPI client currently returns JSON without proof data in responses

2. **Query Construction**
   - Requires contract to be fetched/cached separately
   - Cannot use `verifyDocuments()` without the contract object

## Solution

The solution was to use the `drive` crate with the `verify` feature flag, which provides a WASM-compatible subset of the drive functionality. This allows us to:

1. Directly use `DriveDocumentQuery` and related types
2. Construct complex queries with where clauses and ordering
3. Integrate seamlessly with `wasm-drive-verify`

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Dependencies**: Added `drive = { path = "../rs-drive", default-features = false, features = ["verify"] }`
2. **Query Construction**: Implemented helper functions to convert JavaScript arrays to Rust query types
3. **Value Conversion**: Created `js_value_to_platform_value()` to handle type conversions

## Usage Recommendations

### For Users

1. **For single document verification:**
   ```typescript
   // This works!
   const result = await wasmSdk.verifySingleDocument(
     proof,
     contractCbor,
     "myDocumentType",
     documentId
   );
   ```

2. **For identity/contract verification:**
   ```typescript
   // These work!
   const identity = await wasmSdk.verifyIdentityById(proof, identityId);
   const contract = await wasmSdk.verifyDataContractById(proof, contractId);
   ```

3. **For document queries:**
   ```typescript
   // Currently not available
   // Workaround: Fetch documents without proof verification
   // or implement verification in JavaScript using wasm-drive-verify directly
   ```

### For Developers

To fully implement document query verification, one of these approaches is needed:

1. **Modify wasm-drive-verify** to add:
   ```rust
   pub fn verify_documents_with_serialized_query(
       proof: &[u8],
       query_cbor: &[u8],  // or query_json: &str
       platform_version: &PlatformVersion,
   ) -> Result<([u8; 32], Vec<Document>), Error>
   ```

2. **Create a separate verification service** that:
   - Runs outside WASM (native)
   - Accepts serialized queries
   - Returns verification results

## Conclusion

Proof verification is partially implemented with critical features working (identity, contract, single document). Full document query verification requires architectural changes to either `wasm-drive-verify` or the overall approach to handling complex types in WASM.
