    // when comparing floats, the sign bit has the greatest impact
    // any positive number is greater than all negative numbers
    // if the numbers come from the same domain then the exponent is the next factor to consider
    // the exponent gives a sense of how many digits are in the non fractional part of the number
    // for example in base 10, 10 has an exponent of 1 (1.0 * 10^1)
    // while 5000 (5.0 * 10^3) has an exponent of 3
    // for the positive domain, the bigger the exponent the larger the number i.e 5000 > 10
    // for the negative domain, the bigger the exponent the smaller the number i.e -10 > -5000
    // if the exponents are the same, then the mantissa is used to determine the greater number
    // the inverse relationship still holds
    // i.e bigger mantissa (bigger number in positive domain but smaller number in negative domain)

    // There are two things to fix to achieve total sort order
    // 1. Place positive domain above negative domain (i.e flip the sign bit)
    // 2. Exponent and mantissa for a smaller number like -5000 is greater than that of -10
    //    so bit level comparison would say -5000 is greater than -10
    //    we fix this by flipping the exponent and mantissa values, which has the effect of reversing
    //    the order (0000 [smallest] -> 1111 [largest])
