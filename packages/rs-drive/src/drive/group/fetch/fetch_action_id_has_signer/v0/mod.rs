    /// * `contract_id` - The identifier of the contract.

    /// * `transaction` - The GroveDB transaction argument for executing the fetch operation.
    /// * `platform_version` - The current platform version, used to ensure compatibility.

    /// * `Ok(Some(Arc<DataContractFetchInfo>))` if the signers' power is successfully fetched.
