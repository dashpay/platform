impl Drive {

    /// This function creates a low-level drive operation to update an identity's balance in GroveDB.
    /// The function validates the balance against a predefined maximum to prevent overflow.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `identity_id`: A 32-byte array that uniquely identifies the identity whose balance needs to be updated.
    /// - `balance`: The new balance (`Credits`) to be set for the identity.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// - `Result<LowLevelDriveOperation, Error>`: Returns a low-level drive operation that, when applied, will update the identity's balance in GroveDB. 
    ///   Returns an error if the balance exceeds the maximum allowable value (`MAX_CREDITS`).
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// - `IdentityError::CriticalBalanceOverflow`: Returned when attempting to set a balance that exceeds the maximum allowable value (`MAX_CREDITS`).
    ///
    /// # Usage
    ///
    /// This function is intended to be used internally within the crate's `drive::identity::update` module.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// // Assuming all types and constants are defined
    /// let identity_id: [u8; 32] = /* ... */;
    /// let new_balance: Credits = /* ... */;
    ///
    /// let operation = drive_instance.update_identity_balance_operation_v0(identity_id, new_balance)?;
    /// ```
