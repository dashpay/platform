    /// This function creates a low-level drive operation to set an identity's balance to zero in GroveDB.
    /// This is typically done when a new identity is created or when the balance needs to be reset.

    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `identity_id`: A 32-byte array that uniquely identifies the identity whose balance needs to be initialized.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// - `LowLevelDriveOperation`: A low-level drive operation that, when applied, will set the identified identity's
    ///   balance to zero in GroveDB.
    ///
    /// # Usage
    ///
    /// This function is intended to be used internally and should not be exposed to external clients.
