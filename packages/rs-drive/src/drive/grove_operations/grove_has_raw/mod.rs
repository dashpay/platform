    /// # Parameters
    /// * `path`: The groveDB hierarchical authenticated structure path where the element resides.

    /// * `platform_version`: The platform version to select the correct function version to run.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(bool)` if the operation was successful, returning `true` if the element exists and `false` otherwise.
    /// * `Err(DriveError::UnknownVersionMismatch)` if the platform version does not match known versions.
