    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(i64)` if the operation was successful, returning the total value of the sum tree.
    /// * `Err(DriveError::UnknownVersionMismatch)` if the platform version does not match known versions.
    /// * `Err(DriveError::CorruptedBalancePath)` if the balance path does not refer to a sum tree.
