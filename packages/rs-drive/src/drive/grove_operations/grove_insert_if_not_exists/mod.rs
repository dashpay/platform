    /// * `path`: The groveDB hierarchical authenticated structure path where the new element is to be inserted.

    /// * `element`: The element to be inserted.
    /// * `transaction`: The groveDB transaction associated with this operation.

    /// it collects the cost of this insert operation if the path and key did not exist.
    /// * `platform_version`: The platform version to select the correct function version to run.

    /// # Returns
    /// * `Ok(true)` if the insertion was successful.
    /// * `Ok(false)` if the path and key already existed.
    /// * `Err(DriveError::UnknownVersionMismatch)` if the platform version does not match known versions.
