    /// - `proof`: A byte slice representing the proof to be verified.
    /// - `contract_known_keeps_history`: An optional boolean indicating whether the contract keeps a history.
    /// - `is_proof_subset`: A boolean indicating whether to verify a subset of a larger proof.
    /// - `in_multiple_contract_proof_form`: If the contract proof was made by proving many contracts, the form
    /// of the proof will be different. We will be querying the contract id with a translation to 0 for non
    /// historical and 0/0 for historical contracts. When you query a single contract you query directly on the item
    /// 0 under the contract id you care about.
    /// - `contract_id`: The contract's unique identifier.

    /// represents the verified contract if it exists.

    ///
    /// - The proof is corrupted.
