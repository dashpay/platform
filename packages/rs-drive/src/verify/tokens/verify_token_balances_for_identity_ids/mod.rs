    /// Verifies the token balances for a set of identity IDs.
    ///
    /// This function checks the token balances of multiple identities by verifying the provided
    /// proof against the specified token ID and identity IDs. It also supports verifying a subset
    /// of a larger proof if necessary.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `proof`: A byte slice representing the proof of authentication from the user. This is used
    ///   to verify the validity of the identity and its associated balance.
    /// - `token_id`: A 32-byte array representing the unique identifier for the token whose balance
    ///   is being verified.
    /// - `identity_ids`: A slice of 32-byte arrays, each representing a unique identity ID. These
    ///   are the identities whose token balances are being verified.
    /// - `verify_subset_of_proof`: A boolean flag indicating whether the proof being verified is a
    ///   subset of a larger proof. If `true`, the verification will consider only a part of the proof.
    /// - `platform_version`: The version of the platform against which the identity token balances are
    ///   being verified. This ensures compatibility with the correct API version.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// - `Result<(RootHash, BTreeMap<[u8; 32], Option<TokenAmount>>), Error>`: If the verification is successful:
    ///   - `RootHash`: The root hash of the GroveDB, representing the state of the database.
    ///   - `BTreeMap<[u8; 32], Option<TokenAmount>>`: A map of identity IDs to their associated token balances.
    ///     The `Option<TokenAmount>` can be `Some(TokenAmount)` if a balance exists or `None` if no balance is found.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// The function will return an `Error` if any of the following occur:
    ///
    /// - The provided authentication proof is invalid.
    /// - The provided identity ID does not correspond to a valid balance.
    /// - The provided platform version is unknown or unsupported.
