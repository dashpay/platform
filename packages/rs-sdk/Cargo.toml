# Run integration tests using test vectors from `tests/vectors/` instead of connecting to live Dash Platform.

# part of CI/CD workflows.
#
# If both `offline-testing` and `network-testing` are enabled, "offline-testing" will take precedence.

# Run integration tests using a live Dash Platform network.

# dump all requests and responses to `tests/vectors/`,
# so that they can be used later for `offline-testing`.
