# This script generates test vectors for offline testing of the SDK.
# Test vectors will be generated in the `tests/vectors` directory.
#
# Generation of test vectors is done by running the SDK tests with the
# `generate-test-vectors` feature enabled.
#
#
# Usage:
#   ./generate_test_vectors.sh
#   ./generate_test_vectors.sh test::name
#
# When test::name is specified, only the specified test is run and
# its test vector is generated.
#
# Otherwise, all existing test vectors are removed and regenerated.
