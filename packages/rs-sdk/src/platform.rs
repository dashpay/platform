// TODO: rs-sdk should define a proper user-facing API hiding transport and serialization
// details, however we don't have any data model yet, so for now it will re-export proto
// generated types. Later these re-exports could be swapped with actual rs-sdk's requests
// and while it will change the substance, the API structure will remain the same.
