/// Trait implemented by objects that can be used as queries.
///
/// [Query] trait is used to specify criteria for fetching data from the platform.
/// It can be used to specify individual objects as well as search criteria for fetching multiple objects from the platform.
///
/// Some examples of queries include:
///
/// 1. [`Identifier`](crate::platform::Identifier) - fetches an object by its identifier; implemented for
/// [Identity](dpp::prelude::Identity), [DataContract](dpp::prelude::DataContract) and [Document](dpp::document::Document).
/// 2. [`DocumentQuery`] - fetches [Document](dpp::document::Document) based on search
/// conditions; see
/// [query syntax documentation](https://docs.dash.org/projects/platform/en/stable/docs/reference/query-syntax.html)
/// for more details.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// To fetch individual [Identity](dpp::prelude::Identity) object by its [Identifier](crate::platform::Identifier),
/// you just need to create it and use [Fetch](crate::platform::Fetch)
/// or [FetchMany](crate::platform::FetchMany) trait:
///
/// ```rust
/// use rs_sdk::{Sdk, platform::{Query, Identifier, Fetch, Identity}};
///
/// # const SOME_IDENTIFIER : [u8; 32] = [0; 32];
/// let mut sdk = Sdk::new_mock();
/// let query = Identifier::new(SOME_IDENTIFIER);
/// let identity = Identity::fetch(&mut sdk, query);
/// ```
///
/// As [Identifier](crate::platform::Identifier) implements [Query], the `query` variable in the code
/// above can be used as a parameter for [Fetch::fetch()](crate::platform::Fetch::fetch())
/// and [FetchMany::fetch_many()](crate::platform::FetchMany::fetch_many()) methods.
pub trait Query<T: TransportRequest>: Send + Debug + Clone {
    /// Converts the current instance into an instance of the `TransportRequest` type.
    ///
    /// This method takes ownership of the instance upon which it's called (hence `self`), and attempts to perform the conversion.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `prove` - Whether to include proofs in the response. Only `true` is supported at the moment.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    /// On success, this method yields an instance of the `TransportRequest` type (`T`).
    /// On failure, it yields an [`Error`].
    ///
    /// # Error Handling
    /// This method propagates any errors encountered during the conversion process.
    /// These are returned as [`Error`] instances.
