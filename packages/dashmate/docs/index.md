## Introduction to Dash Platform

Dash Platform is a technology stack for building decentralized applications on the Dash network. It provides developers with functionality for storing and retrieving application data through a decentralized API.

The platform is built as a Layer 2 solution on top of the Dash blockchain, leveraging the security and decentralization of the underlying network while providing the flexibility and ease of use needed for application development.

## Key Components

The platform consists of several key components:

1. **Core** - The Dash blockchain node that handles Layer 1 operations
2. **Drive** - The data storage and processing layer for application data
3. **DAPI** - The decentralized API that provides access to the platform

## Getting Started

To get started with Dashmate, follow these steps:

1. [Install Dashmate](./installation.md)
2. [Set up your node](./commands/setup.md)
3. [Start your node](./commands/start.md)

For developers looking to build applications on Dash Platform, check out the [Dash Platform SDK documentation](https://docs.dash.org/projects/platform/en/stable/docs/index.html).
