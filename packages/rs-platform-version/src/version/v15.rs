/// Introduced as the activation gate for the consensus changes of the 4.3
/// line. Functionally identical to v14 at introduction: the same component
/// version structs, no behavior change. Each change that needs this gate
/// lands in its own follow-up and bumps the component table it consumes here;
/// keeping v15 == v14 until then lets mixed-version validators agree.
///
/// v15 hosts these consensus changes:
///
/// 1. **Chain locks signed by quorums Platform does not hold yet**: a block
///    proposal's chain lock is checked against the chain lock quorums Platform
///    fetched at its last committed core height. When a quorum was mined after
///    that height, inside the same DKG interval, or when the signing height
///    lies between the two stored quorum sets after a jump of the core height,
///    the chain lock is signed by quorums Platform does not hold, and
///    `verify_chain_lock_locally` 0 rejected it although it was valid, failing
///    rounds until Core produced a chain lock Platform could verify or one
///    signed past the DKG interval. `verify_chain_lock_locally` 1
///    (`DRIVE_ABCI_METHOD_VERSIONS_V11`) rejects locally only when Platform
///    holds exactly the quorums active at the signing height, using Dash Core's
///    DKG mining schedule (`core_chain_lock.dkg_mining_schedules`), and leaves
///    the other chain locks to Core. `verify_chain_lock_through_core` 1 has
///    Core's `verifychainlock` check the signature of every chain lock left to
///    Core before `submitchainlock`, which skips that check for a height Core
///    already has a chain lock at or above, and reports a failure as Core's
///    verdict. So v15 accepts valid chain locks that v14 rejected, and rejects
///    forged ones that v14 left to `submitchainlock`'s early return. Protocol
///    v14 and earlier
///    keep `verify_chain_lock_locally` 0 and `verify_chain_lock_through_core` 0,
///    so the blocks committed under them replay with the same verdicts.
///
/// 2. **Proofs of possession of the keys an identity update adds**: the
///    identity's signature over an identity update does not cover the
///    signatures of the keys it adds. The identity update
///    `advanced_structure` 1 (`DRIVE_ABCI_VALIDATION_VERSIONS_V11`) refuses,
///    without a fee and without using the identity's nonce, an update whose
///    added key's proof of possession does not verify (a key whose public key
///    data does not decode fails it too), where 0 charged it; a revision
///    mismatch is still charged. Protocol v14 and
///    earlier keep `advanced_structure` 0, so the blocks committed under them
///    replay with the same results. check_tx verifies these proofs at every
///    protocol version, which decides mempool admission only.
///
/// 3. **DPNS v3 checks a name's create with keywords**:
///    `SYSTEM_DATA_CONTRACT_VERSIONS_V4` selects DPNS contract v3, loaded at
///    genesis (which still inserts the `dash` top-level domain). Its `domain`
///    generates `normalizedLabel` and `normalizedParentDomainName` with
///    `sys.stringTransformations.homographSafeASCII` (a value sent that differs
///    is `DocumentPropertyNotGeneratedError`, 10424). Its `creatorRefersTo` finds
///    the creator's own `preorder` of the name, through `findBy` `$ownerId` and
///    `nameHash` (the sha256d of the normalized label, `"."` and the normalized
///    parent), from an earlier block (`minimumAgeBlocks: 1`), and deletes it
///    (`consume`, beside the `where` entry `$ownerId`); not found is 40120, too
///    young 40142. Its `chooseFirst` refuses the create while another identity
///    holds an unexpired preorder of the name from an earlier block that holds,
///    at `ownerNameHash`, the sha256d of its own owner's id and the name
///    (`ReferencedDocumentPrecededError`, 40149), and the found preorder must
///    hold that hash with the creator's id (else 40120). So a preorder copied
///    from a pending one counts for nobody, and an identity that learns a name
///    from a pending reveal and preorders it itself comes after the revealer.
///    A preorder carries no salt: it holds both hashes, is unique per owner and
///    name (`ownerAndNameHash` over `$ownerId` and `nameHash`, replacing
///    `saltedHash`), is indexed by `nameHash` and creation height
///    (`nameHashAndHeight`) and lives an hour (`ttl` 3600, so it refunds nothing
///    when consumed). A name holds at most 1,000 preorders, the most a
///    `chooseFirst` reads (`max_choose_first_candidates`): the preorder's
///    `atMostAThousandPerName` rule counts them through a countable `nameHash`
///    index (note 4), so a reveal always reads every preorder before its own and
///    no copy can hide an older valid one; a preorder past it is refused (10422). The `domain` keeps `preorderSalt` declared, transient and
///    no longer required, so domains written under v1 and v2 decode. The rule
///    `recordsIdentityIsOwner` (`$transferredAt` equal to `$createdAt` implies
///    `records.identity` equal to `$ownerId`) holds a new name's identity record
///    to its owner (10422); a transfer or a purchase in a later block no longer
///    reads it, and one in the block that created the name is refused. The
///    `domain` sets `canBeDeleted: false`; its property positions, transient
///    list and stored encoding are v2's. `transition_to_version_15` re-stores
///    DPNS through `Drive::apply_contract_rebuilding_document_types`: every
///    preorder made before the upgrade is deleted, unrefunded, and the
///    `preorder` type is rebuilt as a contract update creates a type it adds,
///    the layout a chain born at this version has.
///    `DRIVE_ABCI_VALIDATION_VERSIONS_V11` selects `create_domain_data_trigger`
///    2, which keeps only the parent domain checks: a top-level domain only by
///    the contract owner, the parent present, no subdomains under a name, and
///    the parent's subdomain rule. The data trigger bindings stay at 2: their
///    `domain` Replace and Delete rejects are never reached, as
///    `documentsMutable` and `canBeDeleted` false refuse both first (10404).
///
/// 4. **`countOf` and `sumOf` match byte array keys**: `CONTRACT_VERSIONS_V7`
///    selects `parse_property_constraints` 1, whose grammar binds a filter key
///    to a byte array property of the document written (or deleted), `{
///    "nameHash": "nameHash" }`, and reads that property as a byte array, and
///    whose registration check admits a byte array key of the counted type bound
///    to a byte array property (never a constant, `$ownerId` or `$id`). The count
///    or sum tree holds the key as `serialize_value_for_key` writes it, so
///    consensus reads the total as it reads any other. `parse_property_constraints`
///    0 (protocol version 14) reads such a binding as an integer and refuses it.
///
/// 5. **Tradeable tokens**: `TokenTradeMode::Tradeable`
///    (`TOKEN_MARKETPLACE_INITIAL_PROTOCOL_VERSION`) lets a token's holders list it and make
///    offers for it. Before this version a contract whose token is tradeable, and a
///    `TokenConfigUpdate` that makes a token tradeable, are refused unpaid as not active
///    (`StateTransitionNotActiveError`, 10603), the refusal older software gives by failing to
///    decode the mode. A tradeable token must be transferable (`NonTransferableTokenTradeableError`,
///    10281): contract create and update refuse it unpaid, and the batch `advanced_structure` 2
///    (`DRIVE_ABCI_VALIDATION_VERSIONS_V11`) checks the trade mode an update proposes against the
///    contract the action carries, charged, so check_tx refuses the update too. Protocol v14 and
///    earlier keep the batch `advanced_structure` 1.
///
/// 6. **Documents checked natively**: `CONTRACT_VERSIONS_V7` selects
///    `validate_document` 2, which checks a document against its type's typed
///    validation schema (`document_type::schema::validation_schema`) instead of
///    the `jsonschema` crate, reaching the same verdicts and error codes but for
///    one rule of its own: in a `uniqueItems` list, `0.0` and `-0.0` are one
///    value however long the list. A document type whose schema the validation
///    schema does not represent keeps
///    `validate_document` 1's check. Protocol v14 and earlier keep
///    `validate_document` 1.
///
/// 7. **Schemas checked natively at registration**: `CONTRACT_VERSIONS_V7`
///    selects `check_document_type_schema` 1: full validation checks a
///    document type's schema with the rules of document meta-schema v3 in
///    Platform's own code instead of through the `jsonschema` crate, refusing
///    with the same `JsonSchemaError`. It holds an index property name to 255
///    bytes, where the meta-schema admitted 256 characters, compares the
///    numbers of a list that must be unique, such as an `enum`'s members, by
///    value however long the list, as the document check of note 6 does, and
///    refuses a document type the typed validation schema does not represent
///    (`InvalidContractStructure`), so every type registered from this version
///    has its documents checked natively (note 6). The parser is generation 3
///    at both versions, and loading a stored contract runs no schema check.
///    Protocol v14 and earlier keep `check_document_type_schema` 0.
