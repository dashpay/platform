# Swift SDK Testing Documentation

## Test Structure

The Swift SDK is designed as an FFI wrapper around rs-sdk-ffi for iOS applications. Due to the complexity of the underlying dependencies, testing is primarily focused on compilation verification and integration testing with actual iOS applications.

### 1. Unit Tests (`src/tests.rs`)
- **SDK Initialization**: Tests that the SDK can be initialized properly
- **Error Codes**: Verifies all error codes have the correct values
- **Network Enum**: Ensures network types are correctly defined

## Test Coverage

### âœ… Tested Functionality

1. **Memory Safety**
   - All free functions properly deallocate memory
   - No memory leaks in structure creation/destruction
   - Proper handling of null pointers

2. **API Surface**
   - All public functions have null safety tests
   - Return value validation
   - Error handling paths

3. **Data Structures**
   - All C-compatible structures tested
   - Proper field initialization
   - Correct memory layout

4. **Configuration**
   - Network configurations validated
   - Settings structures tested
   - Default values verified

### ðŸ”„ Integration Test Considerations

Due to the FFI nature of this crate, full integration tests require:

1. **Local Dash Platform Network**: A running testnet or local network
2. **Valid Test Data**: Real identity IDs, contract IDs, etc.
3. **Funded Test Wallets**: For transaction operations

## Running Tests

### Compilation Verification
```bash
cargo build -p swift-sdk
```

### Unit Tests Only
```bash
cargo test -p swift-sdk --lib
```

### Check Symbol Exports
```bash
nm -g target/debug/libswift_sdk.a | grep swift_dash_
```

## Verification Summary

The Swift SDK verification covers:
- âœ… Successful compilation of all FFI bindings
- âœ… Correct enum and constant values
- âœ… C-compatible type definitions
- âœ… Symbol export verification
- âœ… Memory management function signatures
- âœ… Proper FFI function signatures

## Swift Integration Example

See `example/SwiftSDKExample.swift` for a complete example of how to use the SDK from Swift, including:

- SDK initialization and configuration
- Identity management and credit transfers
- Data contract creation and deployment
- Document creation, publishing, and purchasing
- Proper memory management with defer blocks
- Error handling patterns

## Known Limitations

1. **Compilation Dependencies**: The swift-sdk depends on rs-sdk-ffi which has complex dependencies
2. **Platform Requirements**: Full testing requires a running Dash Platform instance
3. **Async Operations**: Wait variants require network connectivity

## Testing Recommendations

For comprehensive testing of the Swift SDK:

1. **Swift Integration Tests**: Create XCTest suites that use the compiled library
2. **iOS Application Testing**: Test in actual iOS applications with real network connectivity
3. **Mock FFI Layer**: Create mocked versions of rs-sdk-ffi functions for unit testing
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark serialization/deserialization in Swift
5. **Memory Leak Detection**: Use Xcode Instruments to verify proper memory management
