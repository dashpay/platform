# Swift Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Type naming mismatches**: Fixed double prefixes (SwiftDashSwiftDash) in the mock implementation
2. **Header file synchronization**: Updated both header files to match
3. **Enum constants**: Added Swift constants file for network types and error codes  
4. **Function signatures**: Updated mock implementation to match the unified SDK API
5. **Memory management functions**: Added missing free functions
6. **SDK handle types**: Changed from `UnsafeMutablePointer<SwiftDashSDKHandle>` to `OpaquePointer`

## Remaining Issues

1. **Document tests**: Need to update to use contract handles instead of string IDs
2. **Identity tests**: Need to update transfer_credits to use new API with identity/signer handles
3. **Result vs Handle returns**: Many tests expect result structs but API returns handles
4. **Missing functions**: Some test functions (e.g., swift_dash_document_search) are not in the API

## Compilation Status

The mock C implementation now compiles successfully. The Swift tests have various compilation errors due to:
- API differences between the test expectations and the unified SDK
- Functions that return handles instead of result structs
- Tests trying to use old API signatures

## Recommendation

The tests need significant refactoring to match the new unified SDK API. The main patterns to update:

1. Functions that previously returned results now return handles
2. Transfer operations now require identity handles and signer handles
3. Document operations require contract handles instead of contract ID strings
4. Some operations from the old API are no longer available

The mock implementation is correctly structured but the tests themselves need to be updated to match the new API.
