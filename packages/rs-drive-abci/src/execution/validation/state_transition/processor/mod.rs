/// There are multiple stages in a state transition processing:
///     Basic Structure
///     Signature
///     Balance
///     Advanced Structure
///     State
///
/// The structure validation verifies that the form of the state transition is good, for example
/// that a contract is well formed, or that a document is valid against the contract.
///
/// Signature validation verifies signatures of a state transition, it will also verify
/// signatures of keys for identity create and identity update. At this stage we will get back
/// a partial identity.
///
/// Validate state verifies that there are no state based conflicts, for example that a document
/// with a unique index isn't already taken.
