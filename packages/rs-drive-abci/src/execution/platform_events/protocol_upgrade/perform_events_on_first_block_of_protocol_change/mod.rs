    /// Executes protocol-specific events on the first block after a protocol version change.
    ///
    /// This function is triggered when there is a protocol version upgrade detected in the network.
    /// It checks if the current protocol version has transitioned from an earlier version to version 4,
    /// and if so, performs the necessary setup or migration tasks associated with version 4.
    ///
    /// Currently, the function handles the transition to version 4 by initializing new structures
    /// or states required for the new protocol version.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// * `transaction`: A reference to the transaction context in which the changes should be applied.
    /// * `previous_protocol_version`: The protocol version prior to the upgrade.
    /// * `platform_version`: The current platform version containing the updated protocol version and relevant configuration details.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// * `Ok(())`: If all events related to the protocol change were successfully executed.
    /// * `Err(Error)`: If there was an issue executing the protocol-specific events.
    ///
    /// # Versioning
    ///
    /// This function uses the `platform_version` parameter to determine which version-specific implementation
    /// of the protocol change events should be executed:
    ///
    /// - If the version is `0`, it calls the `perform_events_on_first_block_of_protocol_change_v0` function,
    ///   which contains the logic for version `0`.
    /// - If no version is specified (`None`), the function does nothing and returns `Ok(())`.
    /// - If a different version is specified, it returns an error indicating an unknown version mismatch.
