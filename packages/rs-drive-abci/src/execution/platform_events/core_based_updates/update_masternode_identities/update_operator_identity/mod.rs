    /// An operator is an entity that has the right to operate a node within a blockchain
    /// network. This method is responsible for updating the details of the operator on the blockchain.
    ///
    /// There are three main attributes of an operator that can be changed: the public key,
    /// the payout address, and the platform node id.
    ///
    /// The `update_operator_identity` function is implemented as a versioned function.
    /// Different versions of the function are maintained to handle changes in the logic over time,
    /// and also to provide backwards compatibility.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `masternode`: a tuple of ProTxHash and DMNStateDiff containing the masternode details and state difference.
    /// * `block_info`: an object containing information about the block where this operation is happening.
    /// * `platform_state`: the current state of the platform.
    /// * `transaction`: the transaction in which this operation is happening.
    /// * `drive_operations`: a mutable reference to a vector of DriveOperations.
    /// * `platform_version`: the current version of the platform.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// This function will return an error if the version of the `update_operator_identity` function
    /// does not match any of the known versions.
