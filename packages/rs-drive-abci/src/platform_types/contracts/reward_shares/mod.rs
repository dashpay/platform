//!
//! This module defines structs and functions related to masternode reward shares.
//!
//! Masternode reward shares are shares of the masternode reward that a masternode owner
//! would like to automatically distribute to addresses other than that of the masternode itself.
//!
//! For example, the address of someone who manages the masternode for the owner.
