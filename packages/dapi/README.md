A decentralized API for the Dash network

## Overview

DAPI (Decentralized API) is the decentralized HTTP API layer for the Dash Evolution platform. It provides a simple interface for accessing the Dash network, both for traditional Dash functionality and for the Dash Platform features.

DAPI is designed to be run on the Dash masternode network, providing a decentralized, high-availability API service with no single point of failure.
