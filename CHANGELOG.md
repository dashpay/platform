## [0.24.0](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/compare/v0.24.0-dev.34...v0.24.0) (2023-05-10)

### Notes

The masternode identities logic is partially disabled due to incomplete Identity V2 implementation and will be enabled back in v0.25.0


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Previous blockchain data and state is not compatible
* Previous created compose projects won't be supported. Please destroy them before update (#1055)
* The --platfrom-only flag is renamed to --platform in the reset command (#991)
* Some wasm-dpp APIs are different to js-dpp ones. The only divergencies that were addressed are the ones that were visible in tests, but some others might've been left intact (#848)
* Core version less than 19 and legacy BLS schema are not supported (#771)
* gRPC and HTTP platform ports now handling with the one single port (#752)
* State Transition fees are changed
* Document's query validation logic has minor incompatibilities with previous version
