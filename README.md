Dash Platform is a technology stack for building decentralized applications on
the Dash network. The two main architectural components, Drive and DAPI, turn
the Dash P2P network into a cloud that developers can integrate with their
applications.

If you are looking for how to contribute to the project or need any help with
building an app on the Dash Platform - message us on the [Devs
Discord](https://chat.dashdevs.org/)!

## Intro

This is a multi-package repository - sometimes also known as monorepository -
that contains all packages that comprise the Dash platform - for example, Drive,
which is the storage component of Dash Platform, the JavaScript SDK, wallet-lib,
DAPI, and others. Every individual package contains its own readme. Packages are
located in the [packages](./packages) directory.

## FAQ

### How to build and set up a node from the code in this repo?

- Clone the repo
- Install prerequisites:
  - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16.0.0+ 
  - [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) v20.10+
  - [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) v1.29.2+
- Run `npm run setup` to install dependencies and configure and build all packages
- Run `npm run start` to start the local dev environment built from the sources
- Run `npm test` to run the whole test suite (note that running tests requires a running node, 
 so be sure to call `npm run start` first). Alternatively, you can run tests for a specific 
 package by running `npm test -w <package_name>`, for example running 
 `npm test -w @dashevo/dapi-client` will run tests for the JS DAPI client. To see 
 all available packages, please see the [packages readme](./packages/README.md)
- `npm run stop` will stop the local dev environment. Running a dev environment requires a non-trivial amount of system resources,
 so it is best to stop the local node when not in use
- Run `npm run build` to rebuild the project after changes. If you have a local node
 running, you may need to restart it by running `npm run stop && npm run start`
- To completely reset all local data and builds, run `npm run reset`
