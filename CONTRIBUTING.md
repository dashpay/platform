Contributing to Dash Platform
=============================

The Dash Platform project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing
and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
contributing.


Branches, Bugfixes and New Features
-----------------------------------

The current stable release is in the `master` branch. This branch is meant to be
stable, so the only PRs made to master should be bugfixes. Development of the
next release happens on the `vX-dev` branch, where `X` is the next version
number to be released. All new feature PRs must be made to the current dev
branch.

The body of the PR should also follow the default PR template that appears when
you open a PR on GitHub. Please fill all template fields with a sufficient
description of what the patch does, together with any justification/reasoning.
You should include references to any discussions (for example other tickets or
mailing list discussions).

If a pull request is not (yet) ready to be considered for merging, please set
its status to "Draft" on GitHub.


Conventional Commits
--------------------

All commits and pull request titles should follow the Conventional Commits
specification. PR titles follow the `<type>(optional scope): <description>`
scheme. Please see the specification linked below for valid types. When making a
change to a specific component, please specify the name of the component inside
the scope. For example, if you are developing a new feature for the SDK, the PR
title should look like this: `feat(sdk): amazing new feature`.

For more details on allowed types and more information about Conventional
Commits, please see the [Conventional Commits
specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). For available
scopes, please see the [.github/semantic.yml](.github/semantic.yml) file.

In general, [commits should be
atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention)
and diffs should be easy to read. For this reason, do not mix any formatting
fixes or code movement with actual code changes.


Code Conventions
----------------

Please ensure that the code you write adheres to the code style adopted in the
project, and that all linting checks are passing. We use [AirBnB
style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for JS code.


Testing
-------

The code must be accompanied by tests to check the functionality. Tests for
individual components are stored inside `packages/<component_name>/tests`, while
e2e test are inside `packages/platform-test-suite`.

Test case names should start with a lowercase "should", i.e. "should do x". Unit
and integration tests should mirror the file structure of `/src` or `/lib`
(depending on the component).

Code should generally be covered by unit and integration tests, and functional
or e2e tests should be written for larger chunks of functionality (when
appropriate). Unit and integration tests should not make any network calls, and
unit tests should mock all dependencies.


Squashing Commits
-----------------

If your pull request is accepted for merging, you may be asked by a maintainer
to squash and/or [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) your commits
before it will be merged. The basic squashing workflow is shown below.

    git checkout your_branch_name
    git rebase -i HEAD~n
    # n is normally the number of commits in the pull request.
    # Set commits (except the one in the first line) from 'pick' to 'squash', save and quit.
    # On the next screen, edit/refine commit messages.
    # Save and quit.
    git push -f # (force push to GitHub)

If you have problems with squashing (or other workflows with `git`), you can
alternatively enable "Allow edits from maintainers" in the right GitHub sidebar
and ask for help in the pull request.

Please refrain from creating several pull requests for the same change. Use the
pull request that is already open (or was created earlier) to amend changes.
This preserves the discussion and review that happened earlier for the
respective change set.

The length of time required for peer review is unpredictable and will vary from
pull request to pull request.


Pull Request Philosophy
-----------------------

Patchsets should always be focused. For example, a pull request could add a
feature, fix a bug, or refactor code; but not a mixture. Please also avoid super
pull requests which attempt to do too much, are overly large, or overly complex
as this makes review difficult.


"Decision Making" Process
-------------------------

Whether a pull request is merged into Dash Platform rests with the project merge
maintainers.

Maintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general
principles of the project and meets the minimum standards for inclusion.

In general, all pull requests must:

- Have a clear use case, fix a demonstrable bug or serve the greater good of the
  project (for example refactoring for modularisation);
- Have unit tests and functional tests where appropriate;
- Follow code style guidelines;
- Not break the existing test suite;
- Where bugs are fixed, where possible, there should be unit tests demonstrating
  the bug and also proving the fix. This helps prevent regression.
