## ðŸŽ¨ API Design Feedback

### Feature Context
**Feature Name**: <!-- e.g., Document Query Builder -->
**Related Issue**: <!-- Link to feature request issue -->
**Implementation Status**: 
- [ ] Design Proposal
- [ ] Prototype Available
- [ ] Beta Implementation
- [ ] Release Candidate

### Proposed API Design

**Current Proposal**:
```javascript
// Paste the proposed API design here
```

**js-dash-sdk Equivalent**:
```javascript
// Show the equivalent js-dash-sdk API for comparison
```

### Design Feedback
