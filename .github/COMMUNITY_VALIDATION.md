# Community Validation Process

This document outlines how the @dashevo/dash-wasm-sdk community validates new features, reports issues, and contributes to the project's development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The Community Validation Process ensures that:
- New features meet real-world developer needs
- Bug reports are actionable and reproducible
- Performance issues are measured and verified
- Community feedback shapes the project roadmap

## ðŸ“‹ Validation Workflows

### 1. Feature Validation

#### **Phase 1: Proposal**
1. **Submit Feature Request** using the issue template
2. **Community Discussion** - gather feedback and use cases
3. **API Design Review** - propose implementation approach
4. **Priority Assessment** - evaluate impact and effort

#### **Phase 2: Implementation**
1. **Alpha Implementation** - initial development
2. **Community Testing** - early adopter feedback
3. **API Refinement** - based on real usage
4. **Documentation Update** - examples and guides

#### **Phase 3: Release**
1. **Beta Release** - broader community testing
2. **Migration Guide** - for breaking changes
3. **Stable Release** - production-ready feature
4. **Feedback Collection** - ongoing improvement

### 2. Bug Report Validation  

#### **Triage Process**
- **Severity Assessment**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Reproducibility Check**: Confirmed, Needs Info, Cannot Reproduce
- **Impact Analysis**: Number of affected users/use cases
- **Root Cause Investigation**: Platform, SDK, User Error

#### **Resolution Workflow**
1. **Bug Confirmation** - reproduce with minimal example
2. **Fix Development** - implement solution
3. **Community Testing** - verify fix in real environments  
4. **Regression Testing** - ensure no new issues
5. **Release and Communication** - notify affected users

### 3. Performance Issue Validation

#### **Benchmarking Standards**
- **Identity Operations**: < 1 second for creation/topup
- **Document Queries**: < 500ms for simple queries
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB peak for typical operations  
- **Bundle Size**: Track and minimize WASM payload impact

#### **Performance Testing Protocol**
1. **Baseline Measurement** - establish current performance
2. **Regression Detection** - identify performance degradation
3. **Optimization Development** - implement improvements
4. **Community Verification** - test in real applications
5. **Performance Documentation** - update benchmarks
