- Documentation completeness score
- Example coverage percentage
- New developer retention rate

#### **Usage Patterns** (Quarterly)  
- Most/least used API endpoints
- Common error patterns

- Integration framework distribution

## 🎯 Feedback Prioritization Framework

### **Priority Matrix**

#### **P0 - Critical (Same Day)**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption/loss issues
- Complete SDK failure
- Breaking changes affecting all users

**Criteria:**
- Affects > 80% of users
- No workaround available
- Potential security/data risk
- Blocks all development

#### **P1 - High (Next Business Day)**
- Major feature failures
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Blocking integration issues
- API inconsistencies

**Criteria:**
- Affects > 50% of users
- Limited workarounds
- Significantly impacts productivity
- Affects core functionality

#### **P2 - Medium (1-2 Weeks)**
- Minor feature bugs
- Performance issues < 50% impact
- Documentation gaps
- Non-critical API improvements

**Criteria:**
- Affects < 50% of users
- Workarounds available
- Moderate productivity impact
- Enhancement requests

#### **P3 - Low (Best Effort)**
- Feature requests
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Cosmetic issues
- Advanced use case support

**Criteria:**
- Affects < 20% of users
- No productivity impact
- Future roadmap consideration
- Community-driven improvements

### **Feedback Scoring Algorithm**

#### **Impact Score** (1-10 scale)
```
Impact = (Users Affected × Severity × Frequency) / 100

Users Affected:
- All users: 10
- Most users: 8
- Some users: 5
- Few users: 2

Severity:
- Blocking: 10
- Major impediment: 8
- Minor inconvenience: 5
- Cosmetic: 2

Frequency:
- Always: 10
- Often: 8
- Sometimes: 5
- Rarely: 2
```

#### **Effort Estimate** (T-shirt sizes)
- **XS**: < 4 hours (documentation, small fixes)
- **S**: 1-2 days (minor features, bug fixes)
- **M**: 1 week (medium features, refactoring)
- **L**: 2-4 weeks (major features, architecture changes)
- **XL**: 1+ months (breaking changes, major rewrites)

#### **Priority Score Calculation**
```
Priority Score = Impact Score / Effort Score

Effort Score mapping:
XS = 1, S = 2, M = 4, L = 8, XL = 16

Higher scores = Higher priority
```

## 📈 Data Collection Methods

### **Automated Metrics**

#### **GitHub Analytics**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/metrics.yml

### **Manual Surveys**

#### **Developer Experience Survey** (Quarterly)
```yaml
questions:
  - How easy was it to get started with the SDK?
  - What's your primary use case?
  - What challenges did you face?

  - Would you recommend to others?
```

#### **Community Health Check** (Semi-annual)
```yaml
focus_areas:
  - Community inclusivity
  - Contribution barriers
  - Communication effectiveness
  - Support quality
```
